What do you thing about a logotype for Arcwright. I know you can't build it, but you can describe it. I would create it in something like Canva, and add it to the bottom of the graphic.
Here's what I'd describe for an Arcwright logotype:

Arcwright Logotype Concept
The Name: "Arcwright" — a portmanteau of arc (story arc, narrative curve) and wright (a maker, as in playwright, wheelwright). Someone who builds arcs.

Typeface Direction: A medium-weight geometric sans-serif with one hand-crafted intervention. Think something in the family of Outfit, Lexend, or Montserrat — clean and modern, but not cold. The letterforms should feel engineered, like something you'd find on a blueprint or technical drawing.

The Key Move: The "A" in Arc has no crossbar — instead, the negative space inside the A forms an upward-pointing arc/curve, echoing a story tension curve rising. This is the logo's signature. It makes the A look like a compass or a peaked graph line. Subtle, but once you see it, you can't unsee it.

Case: Title case — Arcwright. Not all-caps (too aggressive for a writing tool), not lowercase (too casual for something that analyzes structure).

Color: White or very light purple (#e9d5ff) for use on dark backgrounds. The logotype should work as a single color — no gradients in the type itself.

Optional Tagline Lock-up: Beneath the logotype in a lighter weight, smaller size, tracked out slightly:

NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE

This reinforces the "wright" = builder metaphor without over-explaining.

Spacing: Generous letter-spacing (tracking +20-40 in Canva terms). The word should breathe. It's an architecture tool, not a thriller cover.

Pairing with the Mascot Image: The logotype would sit at the bottom of the mechanical pen hand image, centered, with enough padding that it's clearly on the image but not crowded by it. The gradient overlay you already have (fading to dark at bottom) is the natural bed for it — the logotype lands in the darkest zone where text is most legible.

Size Relationship: In the splash context, the logotype should be roughly 40-50% of the image width. Large enough to be the focal point after the image draws the eye, small enough that it doesn't compete with the hand.

If you build it in Canva, export as PNG with transparency so it layers cleanly over the gradient.
