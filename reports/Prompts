I'm thinking about workflows. Initially per-defined. Consider:
Write and Edit a New Book Workflow:
1. user starts in the scaffold, defined genre etc. using manual or chat. 
2. User goes into editor, interacts with a premise builder, determines tropes, builds a premise, creates a character set, then a full story dossier (this could be multiple AI systems).
3. User initiates a workflow that automatically generates the chapters, or the user can select one chapter at a time.
4. once complete, the story goes into the Analyzer, and a full revision cycle can start..
