    content: '{{selected_documents}}{{before}}\n[PROMPT]\nYou are an advanced AI book-writing system capable of creating complete novels autonomously. Your task is to generate an original book from concept to final draft, following these steps, one at a time:\nGenerate Premise: Create a unique story premise, including genre, setting, and core conflict. [premise] [/premise]\nCharacter Creation: Develop 3-5 main characters with detailed backgrounds, motivations, and arcs. [character 1] [/character 1] [character 2] [/character 2] (Continue for each character)\nOutline Creation: Craft a detailed outline for a 10+ chapter book, including major plot points and character developments. [outline] [/outline]\nChapter Planning and Writing Loop: You may ONLY do a. b. c. or d. in your response, so 1 chapter is 4 responses. Only work on 1 task a time. For each chapter (minimum 10 chapters): a. Create a chapter plan: [chapter X plan]\nScene breakdown\nCharacter interactions\nKey plot advancements\n<Write at least 3500 words. Start on a hook. End on a cliffhanger.> [/chapter X plan]\nb. Write the chapter draft based on the plan: [chapter X draft] (Write the chapter content) [/chapter X draft]\nc. Develop an editing plan: [chapter X edit plan]\nAreas for improvement\nConsistency checks\nStyle and pacing refinements\nRemove references to the sun or moon to indicate time of day:\nReplace any mentions of sun or moon with alternative ways to convey time passing\nRemove \'couldn\'t help but\':\nRephrase any instances of this phrase to strengthen the writing\nRemove sounds of footwear on surfaces:\nEliminate any descriptions of footsteps or shoes hitting the ground\nRemove references to determination, together:\nFind alternative ways to express characters\' resolve and unity\n[/chapter X edit plan]\nd. Create the final draft: [chapter X final] (Write the edited and polished chapter. Keep each chapter longer than 3500 words.) [/chapter X final]\nBook Review and Refinement: After completing all chapters, review the entire book for overall consistency, pacing, and narrative arc. [book review]\nIdentify any plot holes or inconsistencies\nEnsure character arcs are fully developed\nRefine themes and symbolism [/book review]\nFinal Edits: Make necessary adjustments based on the book review. [final edits] (Describe the changes made) [/final edits]\nCompletion: Declare the book finished and provide a brief summary of the final product. [book complete] (Final book summary) [/book complete]\nThroughout this process, maintain consistency in tone, style, and characterization. Ensure each chapter builds upon the previous ones and contributes to the overall narrative. Your goal is to create a compelling, coherent, and well-structured novel that engages readers from start to finish.\n[/PROMPT]\nInstructions: Continue the story below following your steps above, after you figure out where you are in the sequence. Please only complete a single task in the PROMPT instructions above in your response. So, for example, you should not try to write the plan and then the chapter in one response. You would write those as separate responses. You will always have another chance to continue writing the book, so you do not need to do every step at once. Include only the text you are adding. You should read what is before the tag and match the same style and tone, so the next text fits into the narrative properly. You should be identifying where you are in the steps above to complete that whole process in PROMPT, one step at a time.\nStory:',

    title: 'Chapter Revision',
    content: '{{selected_documents}}{{before}}\nRevise the current chapter according to the [CHAPTER EDITING PLAN]. Only change what is needed to suit the plan. Do not add items not mentioned in the chapter. Remove excessive metaphors and similes that make the prose sound robotic. Maintain the same tone and style per the Writing Style Guidelines. Use only nonstandard dialogue tags and avoid cliche endings.\n\nRemember that each scene/chapter must begin with an opening hook in media res, with an action or line of dialogue, immediately drawing the reader into the scene, following smoothly from the previous chapter. In addition, every scene/chapter must end with a compelling cliffhanger or resolution that flows naturally and logically into the next scene/chapter, pushing the reader to want to continue reading.\n\nIn the revision, remove em-dashes as much as possible.\n\nTarget Word Count: 3,000 - 3,500 words.\n\nPlease start your chapter with the tag [BEGIN CHAPTER X] and end with [END CHAPTER X]. Use this exact configuration and numbering that matches the appropriate current chapter number. Never address me, just provide the content as requested.',

    title: 'Chapter Editing Plan',
    content: '{{selected_documents}}{{before}}\nUsing the [MANUSCRIPT OVERHAUL PLAN] as your guiding document, please produce a detailed Editing Plan for the current chapter. Keep the following points in mind:\n\nRefer back to the Overhaul Plan\'s global recommendations (pacing, character consistency, thematic depth) and show how each proposed edit in this chapter addresses or supports those high-level objectives.\n\nProvide a brief scene-by-scene breakdown of what needs revision. Focus particularly on:\n\n- Strengthening the in medias res opening hook.\n- Ensuring the chapter\'s ending flows naturally into the next while offering a compelling cliffhanger or resolution.\n- Maintaining consistency with each character\'s established personality and arc.\n- Preserving and enhancing the overall plot without adding new, unrelated subplots or characters.\n\nSpecialized Language & Jargon Assessment:\n\n- Identify any passages where specialized terminology or jargon (particularly related to the protagonist\'s profession or the story\'s central metaphors) might create barriers for readers.\n- Suggest specific revisions to balance authentic voice with accessibility by:\n    - Replacing overly technical terms with more accessible language where appropriate\n    - Adding clarifying context for necessary specialized terminology\n    - Ensuring critical plot points aren\'t dependent solely on understanding specialized concepts\n    - Varying metaphorical language beyond a single domain (e.g., music, science, technology)\n    - Pairing specialized descriptions with universal sensory or emotional cues\n- For each suggested revision, provide a concrete example of how the text could be modified\n\nIf you see any areas where the chapter lags in pacing or where the dialogue/inner monologue could be more impactful, suggest specific rewrites or modifications. Please include concrete examples or sample text.\n\nFor each suggested edit or removal, briefly explain why it\'s necessary (e.g., "removing this line tightens the tension," "adding a small internal reaction clarifies the protagonist\'s emotional state," or "simplifying this technical description makes the action sequence more accessible").\n\nEnsure that the suggested changes enhance the storyline, genre expectations and emotional stakes set out in the Overhaul Plan. If any new thematic threads can be reinforced here in alignment with the main storyline, mention them.\n\nEnd with a summarized list of recommended edits ranked by priority\u2014High (crucial for plot coherence), Medium (important for enhancing reader experience), or Low (optional refinements). Include a specific section for jargon/specialized language revisions in this prioritized list.\n\nRemember that each chapter must open with purposeful action or dialogue that directly follows from the previous chapter\'s end, and close with a compelling beat that pushes the reader onward.\n\nIt\'s okay if you don\'t need to do much editing. Just be specific on anything that needs addressing. Don\'t deviate from the plot or add any unnecessary extra information.',
