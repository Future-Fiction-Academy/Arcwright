Based on my thorough exploration of the codebase, here are 10 feature ideas:

1. Dimension Heatmap Timeline
A grid visualization where rows are the 11 dimensions and columns are chapters, with cells color-coded by intensity. This gives an instant "fingerprint" of the entire manuscript — dead zones, spikes, and arcs all visible at a glance without toggling individual dimension lines on/off.

2. Chapter Transition Smoothness Detector
Flag chapters where dimensions jump too dramatically between neighbors (what the NPE system calls "teleportation violations"). If trust goes from 2→8 between consecutive chapters with no in-between, that's a jarring reader experience. Show a "smoothness score" per transition with specific callouts.

3. Genre Blending Mode
Let users blend two genres with a slider (e.g., 70% Romance / 30% Mystery) to create hybrid ideal curves. The current system forces a single genre, but many manuscripts are hybrids. The blended ideal curve would be a weighted average of the two genre arcs.

4. Series/Multi-Book Tracking
The NPE Micro has full series planning schemas. Allow users to manage multiple books in a project, with arc envelopes that span the series. Track dimension handoff targets between books (e.g., trust should end book 1 at 0.6 so book 2 can rebuild from there).

5. Beat Suggestion Engine
During scaffolding, when the user adds a beat at a given time percentage, suggest what should narratively happen based on the genre template and current dimension state. "At 70% in a Dark Romance, the genre expects a power reversal — trust should crater while danger peaks."

6. Character Voice Consistency Checker
Analyze chapter text for POV voice characteristics — average sentence length, interiority-to-action ratio, vocabulary complexity, somatic vs. visual description density. Flag chapters where the voice profile shifts unexpectedly, which often indicates author drift or unintentional POV bleed.

7. Revision Impact Simulator
Extend the existing projection overlay. Let users select specific dimension changes on specific chapters ("I'll increase trust by +2 in chapters 5-7") and immediately see how the overall health score, gap analysis, and tension curve would change. A "what-if" sandbox for revision planning.

8. Export to Scrivener / Writing App Outlines
Export the scaffolding plan or get-well plan as structured formats that writing tools can import — Scrivener's .opml, Plottr JSON, or a clean Markdown outline with per-chapter revision notes embedded as comments. Writers live in these tools; meeting them there increases adoption.

9. Pacing Pattern Detection for All Genres
The pacing classifier currently only works for romance (slow burn, instalove, etc.). Extend it to all genres — mystery should detect "steady tightening" vs. "twist-heavy" vs. "slow reveal"; fantasy should detect "escalating quest" vs. "episodic adventure." Each genre has characteristic tension shapes.

10. Comparative Manuscript Analysis
Upload two manuscripts (or save analysis snapshots) and overlay their dimension profiles. Compare a draft against a revision to quantify improvement, or compare your manuscript against a "reference" analysis of a published work in the same genre. Show a delta report: "Your revision improved trust arc by 15% but desire fell off in act 3."
